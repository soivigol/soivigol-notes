You can customize this sidebar from a Settings->Soivigol Check List. Here, you can enter a Checklist or Work flow general that is loaded in the editor. You can allow edit this list or no. Also, in this section, you can enter a general text that appears in the editor, in general. And you can show, or no, the Rich Editor to each particular post/page.
